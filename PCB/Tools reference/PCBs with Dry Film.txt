How to design and etch PCBs
=============================

Design your PCB in DesignSpark.
Increase tracks (for signals) and pads to XXX and YYY.
Print in negative.
Print Top Layer as mirror and Bottom as normal in transparent plastic paper.
The goal is that the toner side is put next to the copper clad.


Cut dry film: Fix with your fingers and make sure no bubbles are left. Avoid imperfections.
Fix with two glasses and put in under the sun: 1:20 mins each side should be enough (measured in October, sunny day at 14:00, Madrid).
Develop the board. Wait some more minutes after the copper is completely visible. There may be traces of invisible plastic that might ruin the etching process.
Etch the board: Muriatic Acid and Hydorigen Peroxide 2:1. Just 40ml+20ml should be enough for a small board (10 cm x 7 cm)
Wash and remove the resist layer (blue).
